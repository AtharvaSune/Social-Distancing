# Social-Distancing
Social Distancing using Deep Learning

Using Object Detection and tracking and calculating distance using pixel based implementation

## Detection
For object detection fasterrcnn with resnet 50 backbone is being used which is pretrained on 
MS COCO Dataset

## Tracking
For tracking <b>SORT</b> (Simple Online and RealTime Tracking) is used. The paper for this algorithm is available in the papers folder

## References
For reference I looked at implementation by <a href="https://github.com/cfotache/pytorch_objectdetecttrack">cfotache</a>
